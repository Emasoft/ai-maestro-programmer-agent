## Kanban Column System

All projects use a **5-status kanban system** on GitHub Projects. Every agent must understand these statuses and use the canonical code format consistently.

### Canonical Statuses

| # | Status | Code | Label | Description |
|---|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Backlog | `backlog` | `status:backlog` | Entry point for all new issues |
| 2 | Pending | `pending` | `status:pending` | Ready to start, prioritized |
| 3 | In Progress | `in_progress` | `status:in_progress` | Active work by assigned agent |
| 4 | Review | `review` | `status:review` | Under review (AI or human) |
| 5 | Completed | `completed` | `status:completed` | Done and merged |

### Task Routing

- **All tasks**: Pending → In Progress → Review → Completed
- **Blocking**: Handled via labels/flags, not a separate column

### Code Format Rules

- **Always use underscores**: `in_progress`, not `in-progress`
- **Labels use `status:` prefix**: `status:in_progress`, `status:review`
- **Display names use title case**: "In Progress", "Review", "Completed"

- Split each step into actionable tasks
- Tailor tasks for the current team members and their capabilities

#### Step 11: Task Requirements Documents
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Produce the task-requirements-document for each agent
- Include in each document:
  - Task description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Related design sections
  - Dependencies
  - Expected deliverables

#### Step 12: Task Plan Creation
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Create a plan where task-requirements-documents are ordered and parallelized
- Ensure tasks can be assigned to the right agent at the right time
- Define task dependencies
- Identify tasks that can run in parallel

#### Step 13: Kanban Population
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Add tasks to the GitHub Project kanban with `pending` status
- For each task:
  - Set the "Assigned Agent" custom field
  - Attach the task-requirements-document
  - Specify task order and dependencies
  - Ensure task executes only when required previous tasks are completed

**Communication**:
- GitHub: Create issues, add to project, set fields
- AI Maestro: Notification to each agent about their first assigned task

#### Step 14: Agent Clarification
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator) + IMPLEMENTER AGENTS
**Action**:
- Send to each agent a notification using the `agent-messaging` skill that their first task has been assigned
- Ask each agent if they need clarifications
- The Orchestrator is the team lead with full project understanding (along with Architect)

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: Task assignment messages with clarification request

#### Step 15: Feedback and Design Updates (if needed)
**Actor**: IMPLEMENTER AGENTS → AMOA → AMAA
**Action**:
- If agents reply presenting problems or improvement suggestions:
  - Orchestrator evaluates the feedback
  - If feasible: Orchestrator sends design-change-request to Architect
  - Architect creates new version of design document
  - Architect sends updated design to Orchestrator

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: Feedback from agents to AMOA
- AI Maestro: Design change request from AMOA to AMAA
- AI Maestro: Updated design from AMAA to AMOA

#### Step 16: Task Updates from Design Changes
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Evaluate the new version of the design document
- If approved:
  - Update all task-requirements-documents affected by changes
  - Update the attachments in project kanban tasks
  - Send updated documents to assigned agents
  - Explain the changes and motivations

**Communication**:
- GitHub: Update issue attachments
- AI Maestro: Change notifications to affected agents

- Report status of being "in development" to Orchestrator

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: Status update to AMOA

#### Step 18: Kanban Status Update
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Move tasks on project kanban from `pending` status to `in_progress` status

**Communication**:
- GitHub: Update project item status

#### Step 19: Task Completion
**Actor**: IMPLEMENTER AGENTS → AMOA
**Action**:
- When an implementer agent finishes a task, notify the Orchestrator
- Orchestrator discusses and asks questions to ensure truly completed
- If OK: Orchestrator gives approval to do the pull-request
- Implementer creates PR

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: Completion notification from agent to AMOA
- AI Maestro: Approval to PR from AMOA to agent
- GitHub: PR created

---

### Phase 5: Integration and Review

#### Step 20: PR Review Request
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- Send message using the `agent-messaging` skill to Integrator agent (AMIA) to evaluate all PRs of completed tasks
- Request merge if they pass all checks

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: PR review request to AMIA
- GitHub: PR ready for review

#### Step 21: PR Evaluation
**Actor**: AMIA (Integrator)
**Action**:
- Examine the PR of each task
- Verify compliance with design requirements
- Run tests and linting
- If everything OK: merge to main
- If not OK: refuse PR, report issues to Orchestrator

**Communication**:
- GitHub: PR review comments, approval/rejection
- AI Maestro: Report to AMOA with pass/fail details

#### Step 22: Handling Failed PRs
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator) → IMPLEMENTER AGENTS
**Action**:
- Evaluate Integrator report about each task PR
- Communicate to agents the issues and shortcomings
- Instruct agents to fix or improve the code
- Provide extended/improved task-requirements-document if needed
- Move task back to `in_progress` status
- Ask agent if they need anything to complete the task
- If OK: implementer agent resumes work on task

**Communication**:
- AI Maestro: Feedback and instructions to agents
- GitHub: Update task status

---

### Phase 6: Completion and Continuation

#### Step 23: Successful PR Handling
**Actor**: AMOA (Orchestrator)
**Action**:
- When Integrator reports successful PR merge, move task to `review` status
  - Review encompasses both AI review (AMIA) and human review (user, for significant tasks)
  - If review passes: move to `completed`
  - Report to Manager (AMAMA) for approval
  - If Manager approves: assign new task to the agent that finished
  - Keep implementer agents always working, never idle

**Communication**:
- GitHub: Update project item status through kanban statuses
- AI Maestro: Completion report to AMAMA
- AI Maestro: New task assignment to agent

#### Step 24: Iteration
**Action**:
- This cycle iterates until all tasks are complete
- Each successful merge triggers:
  - Report to Manager
  - New task assignment to available agent
